# Hi, I am Abinav R, Call me Abinav. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project that brings swagger UI attached with rust axum
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Apache Kafka, flink and river
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine learning or backend API for web
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building ML models for production or MLOps

## What do I do for work
My job is to run convert mathematical models in code to production grade software. What are these mathematical models in code? These are what people nowadays call **AI**. I have experience of building and making them available to users for about 4 years now across organizations. 

My newest passion is to make real time ML accessible to all.

## What skills do I have
- **Programming Languages** - Python(Advanced), Rust(Intermediate), C(Intermediate), bash(Intermediate),Go (basic), Javascript(basic),Julia
- **Data Science tools** -Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn, scikit image, Pytorch, Pandas, OpenCV, Flask, PySyft, Plotly Dash,PySpark, Tensorflow
- **Database** - PostrgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB
- **DevOps/MLOps Tool** - Docker, Kubernetes, Gitlab runner, Jenkins, Terraform, MLFlow, feast (fea-
ture store).
- **Cloud Platforms** - AWS (S3 and EC2, ECR, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM), GCP
- **LLM tools** - OpenAI API, Huggingface API, Guardrails, LMQL, jsonformer
